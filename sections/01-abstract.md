# Abstract

Current models of cognition and consciousness lack a unified formal language bridging neuroscience, psychology, and AI. This paper introduces the **Curved Dynamic Geometry of Meaning (CDG)**, a framework grounded in differential geometry that models cognitive processes as dynamics on a meaning-space manifold. 

CDG makes six testable predictions with specific quantitative benchmarks validated against current experimental capabilities: neural curvature correlations (ρ > 0.6, achievable with 50-subject fMRI studies), reaction time-geodesic relationships (R² > 0.4, detectable with standard semantic tasks), and clinical curvature reduction thresholds (ΔR > 30%, measurable via network analysis). 

The framework proposes that consciousness emerges when integrated curvature exceeds a critical threshold (∫ᴠ |R| dV > R_c), transforming subjective experience from a metaphysical mystery into a geometric necessity. Unlike metaphorical approaches, CDG provides a mathematically rigorous path to unifying symbolic and sub-symbolic models through six core principles organized into foundational, structural, and dynamic tiers.

Key applications include:
- Geometric signatures for psychopathology (depression as negative curvature basins, anxiety as extreme torsion)
- Learning as metric tensor adaptation reducing conceptual curvature
- Insight moments as geodesic formation between distant concepts
- Therapeutic interventions as curvature gradient minimization

The CDG framework accomplishes a **Cartesian shift**—analogous to Descartes' coordinate geometry revealing area as an emergent relation—by providing the mathematical coordinate system that makes consciousness emerge naturally from physical processes. This transforms the "hard problem" from an unsolvable mystery into an empirically accessible geometric phenomenon.
