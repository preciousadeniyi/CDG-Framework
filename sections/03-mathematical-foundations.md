# 3. Mathematical Foundations of the CDG Framework


## 3.1 Mathematical Preliminaries


The CDG framework builds on concepts from differential geometry. Key mathematical objects include:

**Manifold (ℳ):** A topological space that locally resembles Euclidean space.

**Metric tensor (gᵢⱼ):** Defines distances and angles on the manifold.

**Connection coefficients (Γᵏᵢⱼ):** Specify how to transport vectors along curves.

**Riemann curvature tensor (Rᵏₗᵢⱼ):** Measures the intrinsic curvature of the manifold.

**Torsion Tensor (Tᵏᵢⱼ):** Captures the antisymmetric part of the connection, Tᵏᵢⱼ = Γᵏᵢⱼ - Γᵏⱼᵢ.

## 3.2 The Meaning-Space Manifold ℳ


The mind's conceptual structure is modeled as a smooth, finite-dimensional Riemannian manifold ℳ. Points represent mental states, paths are cognitive transitions, and geometric properties encode semantic relationships:

**Metric Tensor gᵢⱼ:** Defines the conceptual distance and similarity between mental states. The inner product ⟨u, v⟩ = gᵢⱼuⁱvʲ measures the cognitive "effort" to transition between concepts.

**Connection Γᵏᵢⱼ:** Specifies parallel transport of conceptual vectors, defining cognitive coherence and logical inference paths.

**Riemann Curvature Tensor Rᵏₗᵢⱼ:** Measures the non-commutativity of parallel transport, quantifying conceptual interdependence and the context-dependence of meaning.

**Torsion Tensor Tᵏᵢⱼ:** Captures asymmetric conceptual relationships and irreversible cognitive processes shaped by personal history and temporal directedness.

## 3.3 The CDG Action Principle

The unified dynamics of the meaning-space and semantic content follow from a variational principle. We define the CDG action functional:

# S[g, Ψ] = ∫ℳ [R + λgⁱʲ∇ᵢΨ∇ⱼΨ† + V(Ψ)] √|g| dⁿx

where:

*R* is the scalar curvature of ℳ, governing the intrinsic geometry of the meaning-space.

*Ψ* is a complex scalar field on ℳ representing the semantic field density or degree of conceptual activation.

*λ* is a coupling constant governing the interaction between semantic field dynamics and manifold geometry.

**V(Ψ) = -μ|Ψ|² + ν|Ψ|⁴** is a sombrero potential that models semantic phase transitions, where **|Ψ|²** represents the stability of a particular conceptual configuration.

This action is constructed to model the competition between the mind's tendency to minimize geometric complexity **(R)** and the semantic field's drive toward stable, activated states **(V(Ψ))**. Variation with respect to gᵢⱼ and Ψ yields the coupled geometric-cognitive field equations that govern the framework's full dynamics. Within this formalism, subjective experience is hypothesized to be an intrinsic property of worldlines evolving on a dynamically curved region of *8ℳ** where the semantic field **Ψ** has undergone a phase transition into a coherent, ordered state.
