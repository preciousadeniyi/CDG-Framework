## 3. Mathematical Foundations of the CDG Framework

### 3.1 Mathematical Preliminaries

The CDG framework builds on concepts from differential geometry and Riemannian geometry. Key mathematical objects include:

- **Manifold** (ℳ): A topological space that locally resembles Euclidean space
- **Metric tensor** (gᵢⱼ): Defines distances and angles on the manifold
- **Connection coefficients** (Γᵏᵢⱼ): Specify how to transport vectors along curves
- **Riemann curvature tensor** (Rᵏₗᵢⱼ): Measures intrinsic curvature of the manifold
- **Ricci curvature** (Rᵢⱼ): Contracted form of Riemann curvature  
- **Scalar curvature** (R): Fully contracted curvature scalar
- **Torsion tensor** (Tᵏᵢⱼ): Captures asymmetric connections: Tᵏᵢⱼ = Γᵏᵢⱼ - Γᵏⱼᵢ

### 3.2 The Meaning-Space Manifold ℳ

The mind's conceptual structure is modeled as a smooth, finite-dimensional Riemannian manifold ℳ. Intuitively, this manifold represents the "space" of ideas, where points are mental states, paths are cognitive transitions, and geometric properties encode relationships between concepts:

- **Metric Tensor gᵢⱼ**: Defines the conceptual distance and similarity between mental states. The inner product ⟨u, v⟩ = gᵢⱼuⁱvʲ measures the cognitive "effort" to transition between concepts.

- **Connection Γᵏᵢⱼ**: Specifies how to parallel transport conceptual vectors along the manifold, defining cognitive coherence and logical inference paths.

- **Riemann Curvature Tensor Rᵏₗᵢⱼ**: Measures the non-commutativity of parallel transport, quantifying conceptual interdependence and context-dependence of meaning.

- **Torsion Tensor Tᵏᵢⱼ**: Captures asymmetric conceptual relationships and irreversible cognitive processes shaped by personal history.

**Modular Brain Implementation:**
The brain's modular organization is modeled as a **fiber bundle** structure:
- **Base space B**: Abstract conceptual space with consistent geometric relationships
- **Fibers Fₓ over each point x**: Domain-specific neural implementations (visual, auditory, emotional)  
- **Connection on the bundle**: Cross-modal integration mechanisms
- **Discrete approximation**: Neural computation emerges through lattice gauge theory approaches

### 3.3 The CDG Action Principle

The dynamics of the meaning-space follow from a variational principle derived from fundamental cognitive constraints:

**1. Cognitive Economy**: Mental states evolve along minimal resistance paths → Einstein-Hilbert term R  
**2. Conceptual Coherence**: Mental content tends toward stable interpretations → Ginzburg-Landau potential V(Ψ)  
**3. Mind-World Coupling**: Perception-action feedback → field-geometry coupling λgⁱʲ∇ᵢΨ∇ⱼΨ†

We define the CDG action functional:


# S[g,Ψ] = ∫ℳ [R + λgⁱʲ∇ᵢΨ∇ⱼΨ† + V(Ψ)] √|g| dⁿx


where:
- **R** is the scalar curvature
- **Ψ** represents semantic field density (Ψ: ℳ → ℂ)
- **λ** governs field-geometry coupling strength
- **V(Ψ) = -μ|Ψ|² + ν|Ψ|⁴** models semantic phase transitions

**Semantic Field Interpretation:**
- **Amplitude |Ψ|²**: Salience or intensity of conceptual activation
- **Phase arg(Ψ)**: Relational stance or perspective toward concepts
- **Mexican hat potential**: Explains discrete conceptual identities from continuous neural underpinnings

Variation with respect to gᵢⱼ yields the **cognitive Einstein equations**:


Rᵢⱼ - (1/2)Rgᵢⱼ = λTᵢⱼ⁽Ψ⁾


where Tᵢⱼ⁽Ψ⁾ = ∇ᵢΨ∇ⱼΨ† - (1/2)gᵢⱼ(∇ₖΨ∇ᵏΨ† + V(Ψ)) is the semantic stress-energy tensor.

Variation with respect to Ψ yields the **semantic field equation**:


λ∇ᵢ∇ⁱΨ + ∂V/∂Ψ† = 0


These coupled equations describe the co-evolution of cognitive content and cognitive structure.

### 3.4 Operationalization and Measurement Framework

#### 3.4.1 Constructing the Meaning-Space from Empirical Data

The CDG framework provides explicit procedures for constructing ℳ from multiple data modalities:

**A. Behavioral Coordinates:**
- **Semantic Differential Scaling**: Position concepts along evaluative, potency, and activity dimensions (Osgood et al., 1957)
- **Multidimensional Scaling (MDS)**: Convert similarity judgments into geometric coordinates (Shepard, 1962)  
- **Priming Distances**: Calibrate geodesic distances d(g₁,g₂) from semantic priming effects (Meyer & Schvaneveldt, 1971)

**B. Neural Coordinates:**
- **fMRI Pattern Similarity**: Represent concepts as vectors in neural activation space (Haxby et al., 2001)
- **Effective Connectivity**: Derive connection coefficients Γᵏᵢⱼ from dynamic causal modeling (Friston et al., 2003)
- **State-Space Trajectories**: Track neural population dynamics during cognitive tasks (Cunningham & Yu, 2014)

**Metric Construction from Neural Data:**
For fMRI functional connectivity matrix Cₐ_b:


gᵢⱼ = exp(-β · Dᵢⱼ)


where Dᵢⱼ is graph distance on the functional connectivity network, and β scales sensitivity.

**Connection Estimation from Neural Dynamics:**
For neural population activity x(t):


Γᵏᵢⱼ ≈ (∂²xᵏ/∂xⁱ∂xʲ) · (dx/dt)


This captures how neural trajectories "bend" during cognitive processing.

**C. Cross-Validation Protocol:**
To avoid circularity, we employ triangulation:
- Define metric gᵢⱼ from independent resting-state fMRI data
- Predict behavioral measures (RT, accuracy) without using these measures in metric construction  
- Validate geometric predictions against clinical outcomes not used in manifold construction

#### 3.4.2 Computational Implementation

**A. Discrete Approximation:**
- Graph Neural Networks with learnable curvature parameters
- Ricci flow algorithms adapted from computational geometry (e.g., Surface Evolver)
- Torsion estimation via asymmetric association networks

**B. Dimensionality Selection:**
The effective dimensionality of ℳ is determined empirically through:
- Intrinsic dimensionality estimation (Facco et al., 2017)
- Cross-validated prediction accuracy
- Neural plausibility constraints (biological implementation)

#### 3.4.3 Anti-Circularity Guarantee

These operational definitions are independent of the phenomena we seek to explain:
- Metric derived from covariance, not from curvature measures
- Connection from neural trajectories, not from task performance  
- Curvature from geometric embedding, not from subjective reports

This ensures the framework remains falsifiable and non-circular.
