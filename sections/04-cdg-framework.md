# 4. The CDG Framework: A Three-Tiered Geometric Theory of Mind

## 4.1 Tier 1: Foundational Principles

**Principle 1: Curved Meaning Space**
- **Mathematical Formulation**: Riemann curvature tensor Rᵏₗᵢⱼ ≠ 0 throughout ℳ.
- **Cognitive Interpretation**: Conceptual inference is path-dependent; meaning is fundamentally context-dependent and non-commutative.

**Principle 2: Qualia Threshold**  
- **Mathematical Formulation**: Consciousness emerges when integrated scalar curvature over a coherent cognitive region V₀ exceeds critical threshold: ∫_{V₀} |R|√|g| dⁿx > R_c.
- **Cognitive Interpretation**: Subjective experience requires sufficient integrated conceptual complexity within a unified cognitive domain.

## 4.2 Tier 2: Structural Principles

**Principle 3: Cultural Torsion**
- **Mathematical Formulation**: Torsion tensor Tᵏᵢⱼ = Γᵏᵢⱼ - Γᵏⱼᵢ ≠ 0 captures asymmetric connections.
- **Cognitive Interpretation**: Personal history and cultural background create irreversible, path-dependent conceptual relationships.

**Principle 4: Recursive Self-Mapping**  
- **Mathematical Formulation**: ∃ smooth map ℱ: ℳ → ℳ with attracting fixed points representing stable self-concepts.
- **Cognitive Interpretation**: Meta-cognition and self-awareness emerge from the system's capacity to model its own states recursively.

## 4.3 Tier 3: Dynamic Principles

**Principle 5: Embodied Ethics**
- **Mathematical Formulation**: Metric evolution follows modified Ricci flow: ∂gᵢⱼ/∂t = -2αRᵢⱼ + β∇ᵢΨ∇ⱼΨ†.
- **Cognitive Interpretation**: Moral reasoning develops through feedback between action, semantic coherence, and geometric constraints.

**Principle 6: Healing Geometry**
- **Mathematical Formulation**: Psychological integration minimizes curvature gradients: lim_{t→∞} ‖∇R‖₂² → 0 under cognitive dynamics.
- **Cognitive Interpretation**: Therapeutic change corresponds to smoothing pathological conceptual discontinuities and extreme context-dependencies.
