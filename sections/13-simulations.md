# 13. Toy Simulations and Computational Examples

## 13.1 Overview

This section provides runnable Python implementations demonstrating core CDG principles. These simulations serve as:
- **Conceptual demonstrations** of geometric cognitive dynamics
- **Testbeds** for theoretical predictions  
- **Educational tools** for understanding the framework
- **Foundation** for more advanced implementations

## 13.2 Available Simulations

### Basic Framework Demonstrations

| Simulation | File | Purpose |
|------------|------|---------|
| **Minimal CDG** | `minimal_cdg.py` | Basic emotion space dynamics |
| **Depression Basin** | `depression_basin.py` | Therapeutic curvature smoothing |
| **Insight Moments** | `insight_simulation.py` | Geodesic formation during insight |
| **Run All** | `run_all.py` | Execute all demonstrations |

### Quick Start
```bash
cd simulations
pip install -r requirements.txt
python run_all.py
```

## 13.3 Minimal CDG Simulation

### Core Implementation
```python
class MinimalCDG:
    def __init__(self):
        self.concepts = {
            'joy': [0.8, 0.7],
            'sadness': [-0.8, -0.6],
            'anger': [-0.6, 0.9]
        }
        self.R_critical = 2.5  # Consciousness threshold
    
    def compute_curvature(self, x, y):
        return 1.0 + 0.5*x**2 + 0.3*y**2
    
    def simulate_thought(self, start, end):
        # Geometric thought trajectory simulation
        distance = compute_geodesic_distance(start, end)
        return curved_trajectory
```

### Key Demonstrations
1. **Emotional Geometry**: Thought paths curve around affective regions
2. **Consciousness Threshold**: Regions with R > R_c support subjective experience
3. **Context Dependence**: Meaning changes with conceptual location

## 13.4 Depression Basin Simulation

### Clinical Application
```python
class DepressionSimulation:
    def depression_potential(self, x, y, therapy_sessions):
        # Negative curvature basin representing depression
        return -strength * exp(-distance**2 / 0.5)
    
    def simulate_therapy(self, initial_state, sessions):
        # Therapeutic curvature smoothing over time
        return smoothed_trajectory
```

### Therapeutic Insights
- **Depression**: Deep negative curvature basins trap thought trajectories
- **Therapy**: Gradually reduces curvature gradients
- **Recovery**: Restores smooth cognitive flow through geometric intervention

## 13.5 Insight Moment Simulation

### Cognitive Phenomenon
```python
class InsightSimulation:
    def create_concept_network(self, insight_occurred):
        if insight_occurred:
            # New geodesic forms between distant concepts
            G.add_edge('Problem', 'Solution', weight=1.0)
```

### Geometric Explanation
- **Before Insight**: Circuitous paths between concepts
- **Insight Moment**: New geodesic forms directly connecting concepts  
- **After Insight**: Efficient, direct cognitive pathway available

## 13.6 Simulation Results and Predictions

### Expected Outputs
**Minimal CDG Simulation**:
```
=== CDG Simulation: 'sadness' → 'joy' ===
Start position: [-0.8, -0.6]
End position: [0.8, 0.7]
Geodesic distance: 1.665
Start conscious: True
End conscious: True
CDG Prediction: Curved trajectory due to emotional geometry
```

**Depression Therapy**:
```
Therapy Session 1: Curvature = -2.1 (Severe depression)
Therapy Session 10: Curvature = -0.3 (Mild depression)
Therapeutic Gain: ΔR = +1.8
```

### Quantitative Predictions
| Simulation | Prediction | Expected Value |
|------------|------------|----------------|
| Emotional Distance | Geodesic > Euclidean | +15-30% longer |
| Therapy Effectiveness | Curvature reduction | ΔR > 30% |
| Insight Probability | P ∝ exp(-distance) | R² > 0.4 |

## 13.7 Advanced Simulation Framework

### Multi-scale Modeling
```python
# Neural implementation level
class NeuralCDG:
    def neural_to_geometric(self, spike_data):
        # Convert neural activity to manifold coordinates
        return geometric_representation

# Cognitive dynamics level  
class CognitiveCDG:
    def thought_dynamics(self, current_state, goal):
        # Geodesic-based reasoning process
        return optimal_trajectory
```

### Planned Extensions

4. **Clinical diagnostic tools**
5. **AI consciousness assessment**
