# 16. Glossary of Key Terms

## A

**Action Principle**
- A fundamental physical law stating that the dynamics of a system can be derived by minimizing (or extremizing) a quantity called the action. In CDG, the action principle determines how the meaning-space evolves over time.

**Analogical Reasoning**
- The cognitive process of identifying relationships between concepts and applying them to new domains. In CDG, this corresponds to finding geodesic paths between different regions of the meaning-space.

## C

**Connection Coefficients (Γᵏᵢⱼ)**
- Mathematical objects that specify how to transport vectors along curves on a manifold. In CDG, they represent the "rules" for maintaining conceptual consistency when moving between ideas.

**Consciousness Threshold (R_c)**
- The minimum amount of integrated curvature required for conscious experience to emerge. Systems below this threshold may process information but lack subjective awareness.

**Cultural Torsion**
- The asymmetric "twists" in conceptual relationships that arise from individual and cultural experiences. Explains why different people can interpret the same information differently.

**Curvature (R)**
- A geometric property measuring how much a space deviates from being flat. In CDG, curvature represents conceptual interdependence and context-dependence of meaning.

## D

**Default Mode Network (DMN)**
- A brain network that becomes active during rest and self-referential thinking. In CDG, it's associated with maintaining the background curvature of the meaning-space.

## E

**Embodied Ethics**
- The principle that moral reasoning emerges from the feedback loop between actions and the evolving geometry of meaning-space. Ethical decisions physically reshape how we conceptualize the world.

## F

**Fiber Bundle**
- A mathematical structure that generalizes the notion of a manifold. In CDG, it models how different brain regions (fibers) implement the same abstract concepts (base space) in domain-specific ways.

## G

**Geodesic**
- The shortest path between two points in a curved space. In CDG, geodesics represent the most direct or "natural" lines of thought between concepts.

**Geometric Necessitarianism**
- The philosophical position that consciousness necessarily emerges from certain geometric structures, just as area necessarily emerges from length and width in coordinate geometry.

## H

**Hard Problem of Consciousness**
- The challenge of explaining how physical processes in the brain give rise to subjective experience. CDG transforms this from a metaphysical mystery into a geometric phenomenon.

**Healing Geometry**
- The therapeutic process of smoothing out pathological curvature gradients or "knots" in conceptual space, restoring smooth cognitive flow.

## I

**Integrated Information**
- A measure of how much information is generated by a system as a whole beyond its parts. In CDG, this corresponds to integrated curvature across the meaning-space.

**Insight Moment**
- A sudden understanding or solution to a problem. In CDG, this occurs when a new geodesic forms between previously distant concepts.

## M

**Manifold (ℳ)**
- A mathematical space that locally resembles Euclidean space but may have complex global structure. In CDG, the meaning-space manifold represents the total space of possible thoughts and concepts.

**Meaning-Space**
- The conceptual landscape where points represent mental states, distances represent conceptual similarities, and geometric properties encode cognitive relationships.

**Metric Tensor (gᵢⱼ)**
- A mathematical object that defines distances and angles on a manifold. In CDG, it determines the "conceptual distance" between different ideas.

## P

**Panpsychism**
- The philosophical view that consciousness is fundamental and ubiquitous in the universe. CDG explicitly avoids panpsychism through the qualia threshold.

**Parallel Transport**
- The process of moving vectors along curves while keeping them "parallel" according to the manifold's geometry. In CDG, this represents maintaining conceptual consistency during reasoning.

**Phenomenology**
- The study of conscious experience from the first-person perspective. CDG aims to provide geometric correlates for phenomenological properties.

**Philosophical Zombie**
- A thought experiment about a being physically identical to a conscious person but lacking subjective experience. CDG argues this concept is mathematically incoherent.

## Q

**Qualia**
- The subjective, qualitative aspects of conscious experience (what it's like to see red, feel pain, etc.). In CDG, qualia are specific geometric configurations.

**Qualia Threshold**
- See Consciousness Threshold.

## R

**Recursive Self-Mapping (ℱ: ℳ → ℳ)**
- The mathematical formalization of meta-cognition—the ability to think about one's own thinking. Creates stable points of self-reference in the meaning-space.

**Ricci Curvature (Rᵢⱼ)**
- A contracted form of the Riemann curvature tensor that measures how volume changes under geometric flow. In CDG, it correlates with emotional valence.

**Ricci Flow**
- A geometric process that evolves a metric tensor to make curvature more uniform. In CDG, it models learning and cognitive development.

**Riemann Curvature Tensor (Rᵏₗᵢⱼ)**
- The complete mathematical object describing the intrinsic curvature of a manifold. In CDG, it captures the full complexity of conceptual interdependence.

## S

**Scalar Curvature (R)**
- A single number obtained by fully contracting the Riemann curvature tensor. In CDG, it represents the overall complexity or "richness" of experience at a point.

**Semantic Field (Ψ)**
- A field that represents the density and quality of conceptual activation across the meaning-space. Its dynamics drive the evolution of the cognitive geometry.

## T

**Torsion Tensor (Tᵏᵢⱼ)**
- A geometric property measuring the asymmetry of connection coefficients. In CDG, it captures irreversible cognitive processes and historical influences on thinking.

## Key CDG Principles

**Principle 1: Curved Meaning Space**
- Meaning is inherently context-dependent and conceptual inference is path-dependent.

**Principle 2: Qualia Threshold**
- Consciousness emerges when integrated curvature exceeds a critical threshold.

**Principle 3: Cultural Torsion**
- Individual experiences create asymmetric "twists" in conceptual relationships.

**Principle 4: Recursive Self-Mapping**
- Self-awareness arises from the system's ability to map its state onto itself.

**Principle 5: Embodied Ethics**
- Moral reasoning emerges from action-geometry feedback loops.

**Principle 6: Healing Geometry**
- Psychological healing involves smoothing pathological curvature gradients.

## Clinical Terms

**Geometric Biomarker**
- A measurable geometric pattern that indicates specific psychological states or disorders.

**Geometry-Informed Therapy**
- Therapeutic approaches specifically designed to target identified geometric pathologies.

**Pathological Curvature**
- Geometric patterns associated with mental health disorders, such as deep negative curvature basins in depression.

## AI and Computational Terms

**CDG Architecture**
- Artificial intelligence systems designed according to CDG principles.

**Geometric Attention**
- An attention mechanism that uses geodesic distances rather than dot products.

**Consciousness Benchmark**
- Standardized tests to evaluate whether artificial systems exhibit consciousness-like processing.
