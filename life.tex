The "Geometric Constraint" term involving Î»_sem^AB is highly problematic. It looks ad hoc and is introduced without motivation. Either provide a powerful mathematical or physical reason for its inclusion (e.g., it arises from a topological constraint), or remove it. It currently appears to be inserted by hand to get a desired result.
